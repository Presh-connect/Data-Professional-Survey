## Data Source : 

Data Professional Survey - This is a Dataset used for this analysis which is the "data_professional_project.csv" file, containing detailed information about preferences, needs, and trends in the data professional industry.


## Tools 

- Excel : Data Cleaning 
- PowerBI : Creating Report and Visualization


## Data Cleaning and Transformation

Firstly, I conducted data cleaning nd transformation steps to ensure accuracy and relevance to prepare the data for analysis. I did this in Power Query. 

#### The steps included:

Removing Unnecessary Columns: Columns that were irrelevant to the analysis were removed to streamline the dataset.
Changing Data Types: Ensured that each column had the correct data type (e.g., numeric, categorical).
Calculating Average Values: Computed average values for metrics such as age, salary, satisfaction scores.
Cleaning Unwanted Values: Identified and removed outliers or erroneous values to maintain data integrity.
Removing Duplicates: Ensured that each survey response was unique to avoid skewed results.


## Data Visualization

The cleaned data was used to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI. The following visualizations were included:

- Country of  Survey Takers: A map visual showing the distribution of survey respondents, with the majority being from the USA.
- Favorite Programming Language: A bar chart indicating that Python is the most preferred programming language among data professionals.
- Difficulty to Break into Data: A gauge chart showing that most respondents found it neither easy nor difficult to transition into the data field.
- Average Salary by Job Role: A bar chart highlighting that Data Scientists have the highest average salary, followed by Data Engineers and Data Architects.
- Job Satisfaction Scores: Salary satisfaction with an average score of 4.27 out of 10.
- Work-life balance satisfaction with an average score of 5.74 out of 10.
- Average Age of Respondents: A histogram showing that the average age of survey takers is around 29 years.


## Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides several key insights:

  - Geographic Distribution: The majority of survey respondents are from the USA.
  - Programming Language Preference: Python is the dominant programming language among data professionals.
  - Career Transition: Most data professionals found the transition into the field to be of moderate difficulty.
  - Salary Trends: Data Scientists earn the highest average salaries, with Data Engineers and Data Architects following closely.
  - Job Satisfaction: The average satisfaction scores indicate room for improvement in salary 
and work-life balance among data professionals.
  - Demographics: The average age of respondents is around 29, indicating a relatively young professional demographic.

## Conclusion

  This Power BI project provides a detailed analysis of the survey responses from data professionals. The insights gained from this project can help organizations understand the demographic and professional landscape of data professionals, their preferences, challenges, and satisfaction levels. The interactive dashboard serves as a valuable tool for visualizing and interpreting the survey data effectively.
